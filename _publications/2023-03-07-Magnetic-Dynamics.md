excerpt: 'Half-metallic Heusler alloys are receiving significant attention for spintronic applications utilizing magnetic tunnel junctions and requiring large spin polarization. Co2MnSi (CMS) is one of the most promising candidates for this purpose. Here, we report the magnetization dynamics of a thin, epitaxial CMS film in a magnetic CoFe/CMS bilayer structure sputtered on an MgO substrate. The magnetic precession frequency response of the CoFe/CMS bilayer shows a fourfold symmetry with respect to the azimuthal applied field angle, reflecting the crystal symmetry of the CMS layer and not the underlying CoFe film. Moreover, the effective Gilbert damping parameter exhibits inhomoge- neous broadening at lower applied magnetic fields. At large fields, however, the azimuthal angle dependence disappears, and the intrinsic Gilbert damping is observed. This study provides insight into the dynamics of a magnetic bilayer structure that forms an integral element in spintronic applications.'
